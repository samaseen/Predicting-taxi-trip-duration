# Predicting-taxi-trip-duration

In this project, our objective is to predict the duration of taxi trips for a particular customer using a logistic regression model. We have been provided with a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about taxi services, including various features that can influence trip duration. Additionally, we have a separate test dataset for which we need to forecast the trip durations.

### Data Collection and Exploration:

We begin by loading the provided dataset, which includes historical data on taxi trips. This data contains various features such as pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, passenger count, and other relevant attributes.
We perform an initial exploration of the data to understand its structure, identify any missing values, and detect outliers.

### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:

We handle missing values by either imputing them with appropriate statistics or removing the affected rows, ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis.
We convert categorical variables, such as vendor ID and store-and-forward flag, into numerical representations using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.

### Feature Engineering:

We create new features that could potentially improve the model's performance. For example, we can extract day of the week, hour of the day, and other temporal features from the timestamps.
We scale numerical features to standardize the data, which helps in achieving better model performance.

### Model Training:

We split the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
Using the training set, we train a logistic regression model. Despite logistic regression traditionally being used for classification tasks, we adapt it for predicting trip durations by treating it as a regression problem.

### Model Evaluation:

We evaluate the trained model using the testing set, measuring its performance with appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
We visualize the model's predictions versus the actual trip durations to assess its accuracy and reliability.
Prediction on Test Dataset:

We apply the trained model to the separate test dataset provided. This involves preprocessing the test data in the same way as the training data and generating predictions for the trip durations.

### Data Visualization:

Throughout the project, we use data visualization techniques to better understand the data and the model's performance.
We create visualizations of the predicted trip durations to gain insights into the model's predictions and identify any patterns or anomalies.

By following these steps, we aim to build a robust logistic regression model capable of accurately predicting taxi trip durations. This project not only enhances our understanding of the factors influencing trip duration but also showcases our ability to preprocess data, engineer features, train machine learning models, and visualize the results effectively.
